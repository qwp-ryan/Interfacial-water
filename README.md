## Interfacial water and water-gas interfaces
The behavior of water at interfaces is unusual due to its strongly-hydrogen-bonded nature and its ability to hold a charge.

>and certainly not as simple as often assumed. Even as we struggle over the best description for the bulk structuring of water and the water’s interactions with ions and other solutes, the surface of water is even more challenging. Its structure varies with temperature, gas molecules binding, ions binding or being excluded, electrical gradients being set up and its dielectric and chemistry changes with apparent unpredictability. Further, both sides of the interface have µm thick unstirred layers different from the bulk(gas or liquid) phases.
 
>How far do the gas and liquid surfaces extend? Certainly, the volume of liquid water considered ‘surface’ should be electrically neutral and this is one definition for the surface thickness for water. 

How many definitions of the surface thickness for water?

>The interface must include the outer monolayer, the boundary that gives rise to any zeta potential,<sup>b</sup> any double layer of ions, plus deeper layers where there is surface-influenced anisotropy in either charge or structure. 

The anisotropy is the key, But the anisotropy is only stands for the topology characters. How about the relaxation? or the relaxation is the subsequent of the anisotropy? 

>The depth of this surface remains undetermined but it is likely to be somewhat greater than given by most techniques that look only at a restricted range of selected properties. 

undetermined:? large.

>There is much direct evidence for an effective depth of the liquid surface measured in many nanometers [2751]. 

This citation should be read carefully. Especially for the definition of the surface depth. 
The surface water is different water around a solute molecule? 

>Clearly, such a definition of surface depth cannot encompass a charged surface. Therefore, any charge seen on the surface may depend upon the surface layer thickness under consideration. It may well vary between methodologies with different probe depths.  Also confusing the issue is that the surface is rough (with \~ 15% increased surface area [2697] ) rather than planar and is in constant flux rather than thermodynamically static. In a difference to hydrophobic solid/water interfaces, the gas/water surface is not flat, even in the most still conditions. It has surface nanoscopic waves (\~ Å, [2697] ) existing on the water that scatter light with low intensity [2407]. Energetic considerations indicate, however, that these surface capillary waves are unlikely to be more than about a water diameter high due to water’s high surface tension. In addition to this, several million monolayers exchange with the gas phase every second [2408] and cause evaporation-dependent temperature gradients [2714], so giving rise to long-lasting surface discontinuities and non-equilibrium [2409]

>The density, dielectric permittivity [738] and dipole moment of interfacial water change from their bulk water values to those of the gas over a distance generally regarded as less than about a nanometer. Thus, water’s solvation and ionization properties change at the interface, with most ions and hydrophilic solutes generally being less evident at the interface but non-polar gasses being more soluble there [1259]. Ions, including hydrogen and hydroxide ions, and other solutes behave differently at the surface to their behavior in the bulk. An important property of the surface concerns how it affects the local ion distribution. Some ions such as thiocyanate (SCN <sup>-</sup> ), azide (N3 <sup>-</sup>) and iodide (I <sup>-</sup>) [2778], prefer the surface whereas others avoid it, as shown by their effects on the surface tension [674] and bubble coalescence [672]. 

 
 
>Interfacial water molecules at the gas-liquid surface have a strong attraction towards the bulk liquid causing a high surface tension. 

Gas-liquid surface, our goal is more common, we concered with the interface between bulk water and anything else.

>Liquid water at liquid-solid and liquid-gas interfaces behaves as a separate thermodynamic system from bulk water [2263]. 
a separate thermodynamic system [2263]? That is not specific.

>Liquid water at interfaces can be investigated using x-ray reflectivity [2266], vibrational sum-frequency generation spectroscopy (VSFG) [1468] and atomic force microscopy [738]. Gas at air-water and other gas-water interfaces behaves like a flat hydrophobic surface g with the difference that the van der Waals interactions between the liquid and gas surfaces are negligible. The surface will be strongly attracted to probes approaching from the gas side at distances of about a micrometer and jumping into contact when still over 100 nm distant [1294], thus showing the long-range nature of the attractive van der Waals forces. Interfacial water absorbs light differently to bulk water with both absorptions at 270 nm [1328] and at 670 nm [2377] being described. The structure of the surface is not completely understood <sup>j</sup> but some information has been determined. 

 

>The necessarily under-coordinated(在协调的) water molecules at the surfaces of both ice and water form similar ice-like, low-density phases that are hydrophobic, stiffer, superfluidic and thermally more stable than the bulk water [2004]. Hydrogen bonding in the surface is stronger than in the bulk [1261] (and this has an effect on the osmotic pressure) but some hydrogen bonding is lost, giving a more reactive environment [594] and greater ice nucleation [914]. The increased strength of surface water hydrogen bonds is partially due to the reduced competition from neighboring water molecules [2030] but has little effect on their vibrational lifetime [1262]. This stronger bonding is due to lower anti-cooperativity and compensation for the increased chemical potential on the loss of some bonding. This surface hydrogen-bonding gives rise to long-range specific ion effects on the aerial surfaces where tiny amounts of dodecahedral cluster-stabilizing ions (such as ClO4<sup>-</sup>) affect the water clustering around distant similar ions (such as I<sup>-</sup>) [2139]. The diffusion within the surface is increased for some surface molecules but decreased for others and depends on the number of hydrogen bonds and size of the water clusters [1263]. The O···O distance, between surface water molecules, within 2-3 nm from the surface, expands by 5.9 % at 25 °C. Analysis of simple thermodynamics <sup>c</sup> shows the surface probably has considerable structuring, having the identical density to that of bulk water at just under 4 °C. In addition, the surface water structuring varies less with temperature than the bulk. Refractive index study of the water-air surface reveals it to be about 1.7 nm thick at 22 °C and denser than the bulk liquid (that is, it behaves like water at a lower temperature) [1482]. Recent vibrational spectroscopy shows this surface to be relatively homogeneous [1468a,c] although this work is questioned [1468b]. About a quarter of the water molecules each have a 'dangling' O-H group [415, 1613] pointing at a slight angle out of the water [594, 1261, 2541] whilst slightly more have 'dangling' acceptor electron positions [2334] similar to water-hydrophobe surfaces, creating a slight negative charge on the surface. 

>a 2D-IR VSFG analysis shows fast intramolecular and intermolecular energy transfer processes at aqueous interfaces with stretch excitations moving both along the surface plane and down into the bulk [2412]. 

 

>Sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy (SFVS)shows that water's libration frequency at the air/water interface is 834 cm<sup>-1</sup>, compared with the bulk value of ~670 cm<sup>-1</sup> while the OH stretch, time-averaged structure, and ps structural dynamics all show no change [2785]. This indicates that although there is little change in water's hydrogen bonding length at the interface, these hydrogen bonds are stiffer in terms of their rotation, as happens at other hydrophobic surfaces. SFVS also shows the doubly donor-acceptor and singly donor-acceptor water molecules are the main hydrogen-bonded species in bulk water with singly donor-acceptor water molecules the primary species at the air/water interface [2894].

 

>The density, dielectric (permittivity, [738b]) and dipole moment of interfacial water change from their bulk water values to that of the gas over a distance of less than about a nanometer. Thus water’s solvation and dissociation properties also change at the interface, with ions and hydrophilic solutes generally being less soluble but non-polar gases more soluble [1259]. Ions, including hydrogen and hydroxide ions, and other solutes will behave differently at the surface to their behavior in the bulk. Perhaps the most important property of the surface, after the surface tension, concerns how it affects the local ion distribution. Some ions prefer the surface as shown by their effect on the surface tension (Jones-Ray effect) [674] and bubble coalescence. Both OH<sup>-</sup> [1025, 1266] and H3O<sup>+</sup> [1308] can sit at gas/water interfaces, although clearly not at the same time due to their rapid recombination to form H2O within this lower dielectric interface. As OH<sup>-</sup> ions are preferred over H3O<sup>+</sup> ions (above about pH 3-4), f this generally reinforces the interface's negative charge compared with the bulk. Strong acids like HCl and particularly HNO3 re-associate at the interface [2190], so allowing their evaporation. However weak acids, such as formic and acetic acids, have a strong surface preference but dissociate more rapidly when at the surface, so reducing evaporation [2787].
