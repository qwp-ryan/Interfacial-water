The surface of water
The air-water surface is a very complex system [2629] and certainly not as simple as often assumed. Even as we struggle over 
the best description for the bulk structuring of water and the water’s interactions with ions and other solutes, the surface of 
water is even more challenging. Its structure varies with temperature, gas molecules binding, ions binding or being excluded, 
electrical gradients being set up and its dielectric and chemistry changes with apparent unpredictability. Further, both sides of 
the interface have µm thick unstirred layers different from the bulk(gas or liquid) phases.

How far do the gas and liquid surfaces extend? Certainly, the volume of liquid water considered ‘surface’ should be electrically 
neutral and this is one definition for the surface thickness for water. The interface must include the outer monolayer, the 
boundary that gives rise to any zeta potential, any double layer of ions, plus deeper layers where there is surface-influenced 
anisotropy in either charge or structure. The depth of this surface remains undetermined but it is likely to be somewhat greater 
than given by most techniques that look only at a restricted range of selected properties. There is much direct evidence for 
an effective depth of the liquid surface measured in many nanometers [2751]. Clearly, such a definition of surface depth cannot 
encompass a charged surface. Therefore, any charge seen on the surface may depend upon the surface layer thickness under 
consideration. It may well vary between methodologies with different probe depths.  Also confusing the issue is that the surface 
is rough (with \~ 15% increased surface area [2697] ) rather than planar and is in constant flux rather than thermodynamically 
static. In a difference to hydrophobic solid/water interfaces, the gas/water surface is not flat, even in the most still conditions. 
It has surface nanoscopic waves (\~ Å, [2697] ) existing on the water that scatter light with low intensity [2407]. Energetic 
considerations indicate, however, that these surface capillary waves are unlikely to be more than about a water diameter high 
due to water’s high surface tension. In addition to this, several million monolayers exchange with the gas phase every second [2408] 
and cause evaporation-dependent temperature gradients [2714], so giving rise to long-lasting surface discontinuities and 
non-equilibrium [2409]
